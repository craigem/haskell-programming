{- Exercises: Heal the Sick
The following code samples are broken and wonâ€™t compile. The first
two are as you might enter into the REPL; the third is from a source
file. Find the mistakes and fix them so that they will.  -}

-- 1. let area x = 3. 14 * (x * x)
let area x = 3.14 * (x * x)

-- 2. let double x = b * 2
let double x = x * 2

{- 3. x = 7
       y = 10
      f = x + y
-}
x = 7
y = 10
f = x + y
